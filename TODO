Session creation complete

Need to:

Add dynamic table data fetching from a database rather then hardcoded
Add record filtering and sorting in the table
Add the ability for users to switch org accounts (current org)
Enhance the UI, adding colour to the table + customisation for this feature
Add the ability to invite members to the org.

Stretch Goals:

Add stripe payment integration (good experience working with the API / SDK)
Analytics page to analyse the records / overview of all the data

Integrate OpenAI Agents into the application via the OpenAI Agents SDK.
This could include MCP tools to access the tables information / analytics info.
This could also include, summarisation from the Agent of trends found within the records etc.
